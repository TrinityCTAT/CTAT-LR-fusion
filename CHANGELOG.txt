# ctat-LR-fusion v0.9.0
- ctat-minimap2 update for chimeric reads 
- includes default filtering at the 0.1 FFPM threshold
- igv-reports upgrade, better performance and highlight fusion breakpoints as ROIs

devel versions:
      # --discarded-- (ctat-LR-fusion v0.8.0  
      - incorporates latest ctat-minimap2 with additional alignment filtering during chimeric mode for phase-1 of ctat-LR-fusion finding.
      - (performance issues, do not use)

      # ctat-LR-fusion v0.7.0
      - included --min_FFPM (with default at 0.1), important when tackling massive data sets to avoid pursuing hundereds of thousands of candidates in phase 2.


# ctat-LR-fusion v0.6.0
- bugfixes for non-ref-splice coordinate assignments
- added option: --snap_dist <int>               :  if breakpoint is at most this distance from a reference exon boundary, position gets snapped to the splice site.
- added option: --min_frac_dom_iso_expr <float>     : minimum expression of dominant isoform (default: 0.05)
- adjusted minimap2 alignment params used.
- exits gracefully if no fusions found in initial phase.
- cleaner organization of IGV-prep files.
